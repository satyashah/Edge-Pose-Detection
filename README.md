# Pose Detection and Outlining for Virtual Clothing Try-On

## Introduction

This repository contains code that focuses on identifying the pose of a person in a given image and generating an outline of the individual. This project is a small portion of a larger application aimed at enabling users to try on virtual clothes on their photos to assess how they fit and look. By providing a fit percentage value, users can make informed decisions about their online clothing purchases. As the project evolved, it was adapted to support live input media from users, enhancing the interactive experience.

This endeavor was a collaborative effort that required the skills and expertise of a dedicated team of programmers. Their collective contributions and dedication were instrumental in bringing this project to fruition. We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the members who played key roles in the development of this application.

Their combined knowledge and effort helped shape the project, from conceptualization to implementation, resulting in the creation of a robust and user-friendly application.

## Repository Content

The code in this repository represents the baseline initial testing phase of the pose detection and outlining functionality. It provides a foundation for the subsequent development stages, which are not available for public view at this time. Please keep in mind that the code provided here is for demonstration purposes and may not include the full range of features and optimizations implemented in the final application.

## Technology Stack

To achieve pose detection and outlining, we leveraged the capabilities of OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library. OpenCV's pre-trained model played a pivotal role in accurately identifying the pose of individuals in the provided images. Its robustness and versatility allowed us to process images effectively and generate outlines that closely match the contours of the individuals.

## Conclusion

The pose detection and outlining functionality showcased in this repository represent an essential component of a larger application aimed at facilitating virtual clothing try-on experiences. While the code provided here serves as a starting point, the final application boasts a comprehensive set of features and optimizations to enhance user interaction and accuracy.

We extend our sincere appreciation to the talented team of programmers and contributors who made this project possible. Their dedication, expertise, and collaborative spirit were instrumental in achieving the desired outcomes.
