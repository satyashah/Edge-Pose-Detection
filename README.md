# Edge-Pose-Detection

This is a small portion of another app which would allow us to place online clothes on our photos to test how fit and look, returning a fit percentage value.
The code allows for edge detection of photoes along with the location of major features so we can fit on clothing. Eventually this was adapted to live input media from users.
